rs4988235,AG,Lactosa,Puedes digerir la lactosa en edad adulta (lactasa persistente).,https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs4988235,"Also known as ""C/T(-13910)"" or just 13910T, and located in theMCM6gene but with influence on the lactaseLCTgene,rs4988235is one of two SNPs that is associated with the primary haplotype associated with hypolactasia, more commonly known aslactose intolerancein European populations. [PMID 11788828], [PMID 15114531]"
rs762551,AA,Cafeína,Metabolizadora rápida: puedes tomar más café sin efectos fuertes.,https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs762551,"rs762551, also known as -164A>C or -163C>A, is a SNP encoding the CYP1A2*1F allele of theCYP1A2gene. CYP1A2 is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of caffeine and some drugs."
rs1800497,GG,Dopamina / riesgo de adicción,"Genotipo neutro, sin aumento del riesgo de adicción.",https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs1800497,"rs1800497, a SNP also known as the TaqIA (or Taq1A) polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptorDRD2gene (even though it is actually located over 10,000bp downstream of the gene), gives rise to the DRD2*A1 allele, whereasrs1800497(C) gives rise to the DRD2*A2 allele. The minor allele (i.e. A1,rs1800497(T)) is associated with a reduced number of dopamine binding sites in the brain [PMID 9672901], and it has been postulated to play a role inalcoholism,smoking, and certain neuropsychiatric disorders."
rs1799971,AA,Tolerancia al dolor,Genotipo común. No afecta significativamente la tolerancia al dolor.,https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs1799971,"Thers1799971(G) allele in exon 1 of the mu opioid receptorOPRM1gene causes the normal amino acid at residue 40, asparagine (Asn), to be replaced by aspartic acid (Asp). In the literature this SNP is also known as A118G, N40D, or Asn40Asp."
rs738409,CG,Riesgo hepático (hígado graso),Una copia de riesgo. Cuida tu dieta y evita exceso de alcohol.,https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs738409,"rs738409is a SNP in thePNPLA3gene. In allHapMappopulations the most common allele is a C on the plus strand (coding for 148I), which means a G on the minus strand as represented for this SNP in dbSNP and in SNPedia. In the scientific literature, however, most authors appear unaware that this SNP is defined as oriented on the minus strand, so they refer incorrectly to rs738409(G) as the minor allele. The genotypes defined in SNPedia are correct for the minus orientation of this SNP, but this can be confusing since it's the opposite of what the literature indicates in many cases."
rs9939609,AT,Obesidad (FTO),"Riesgo intermedio, mayor apetito o menor saciedad.",https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs9939609,"rs9939609is aSNPin the fat mass and obesity associatedFTOgene, aka the ""Fat Gene""[1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869]."
rs1801133,AG,Ácido fólico / MTHFR,Una copia alterada. Puede ser útil complementar con ácido fólico.,https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs1801133,"rs1801133is a SNP that is relatively common and has been studied for (relatively) a long time. Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in theMTHFRgene, which encodes an enzyme involved infolatemetabolism."
rs1695,AA,Detoxificación (GSTP1),Buena capacidad de detoxificación natural.,https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/rs1695,"This SNP, in theGSTP1gene influencesasthmarisk; the (A) allele encodes the Ile, while the (G) allele encodes the Val. This SNP is also known as GSTP1Val105, or GSTP1 Ile105Val."
